  <!-- About Me Content -->
    <h1>My Bio</h1><br>
    <p>A collaborative, analytical and enthusiastic 'girl coder' and coffee expert with a passion for social impact. I have a data analytics certification from the University of Western Australia, where I learned how to use Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau to analyze, visualize, and communicate data insights. Currently a student with She Codes Australia on the 2024/25 She Codes Plus cohort, with an aim to enter the realm of tech as a junior software developer. <br><br> 

        Previously, I was the operations director at SEND Coffee, a London-based non-profit social enterprise that trains and employs young people with special educational needs and disabilities in the specialty coffee industry. I also ran my own coffee-centric training business, Homeground, and spent time in coffee origin countries to broaden my knowledge scope and learn from coffee producers directly. <br><br>
        
        Ultimately, my goal is to combine my passion for teaching, community and positive leadership with my new career in tech at like-minded organisations in Perth (and around the world). <br><br>
        
        Fun facts: I have... <br>

        Had formal sourdough bread training to become a sourdough baker! üçû</p>
